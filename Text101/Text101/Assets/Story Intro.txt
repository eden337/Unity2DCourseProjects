 Our main protagenist is fell a sleep while celebrating with the ladies all night long
 The next morning, the captain found himself on his bed and got a bad hangover,
 one of his crew were crying for help: "Hey!!! Captain!!! Wake Up, we are under attack!!!"

 The captain has two choises:
 1.Go back to sleep (and its a certain death to every one)
 2.Get up and what is going on the ship.
